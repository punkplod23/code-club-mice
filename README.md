# 🔓 Operation: Human Logic (Code Club Edition)

## Overview
In cybersecurity, a system is only as strong as its weakest link. Often, that link isn't the firewall or the encryption—it’s the person sitting at the keyboard. This workshop combines **Physical Security (Lock Picking)** with **Psychological Manipulation (Social Engineering)** using the **MICE Framework**.

---

## 🛠 The Challenge
1. **The Breach:** Use your tools to bypass the physical lock on the "Server Box."
2. **The Intelligence:** Inside, you will find a **Target Profile** (a fake identity).
3. **The Exploit:** Analyze the profile and determine which **MICE** tactic would most effectively persuade this person to hand over their credentials.

## 🧠 The MICE Framework
When social engineers target an individual, they look for one of four "bugs" in human nature:

| Letter | Motivator | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **M** | **Money** | Targets financial stress, greed, or the need for quick cash. |
| **I** | **Ideology** | Targets beliefs. Persuading someone that "doing the wrong thing" is for a "greater good." |
| **C** | **Coercion** | Using pressure, threats, or blackmail to force someone's hand. |
| **E** | **Ego** | Appealing to vanity, the desire for recognition, or the need to feel smart. |

## 🛡 Discussion: How to Patch
Once you've identified the vulnerability, how do we "patch" these humans?

> **Remember:** You can't patch a human with a software update. Awareness is the only firewall.
